== About kendo-ui-forms

A Full-Featured HTML5 Forms Polyfill that leverages Kendo UI Widgets and Framework Validation

image::https://travis-ci.org/kendo-labs/kendo-ui-forms.png[Build Status, link="https://travis-ci.org/kendo-labs/kendo-ui-forms"]

== Purpose & Goals

The purpose of this project is to serve as a complete polyfill for http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/forms.html[HTML5 Forms] functionality, including support for new input types--like color and datetime--new attributes--like placeholder and pattern--and validation. This project includes built-in feature detection and, by-default, will only polyfill those forms features not present in the user's browser. To polyfill forms features, Kendo UI widgets and framework features will be used.

If developers prefer not to use the default behavior, they will be able to configure the polyfill to always use Kendo UI widgets and features, even in cases where the browser natively supports these.

This library will function as an opt-in polyfill, meaning that the developer will need to initialize a form using Kendo UI's imperative, plugin syntax (eg. +$('form').kendoForm();+) or with declarative syntax on an HTML form element (eg. +<form data-role="form">+). 

*Goals*

- **Provide a complete HTML5 Forms solution that leverages Kendo UI for visual widgets and features like validation**.
- **Enable developers to mark up forms using HTML5 Forms semantics and automatically gain support for these in non-supporting browsers**. Anecdotally, in a future world where all browser fully support the forms spec, a developer should be able to remove the script reference for this library and the single attribute or line of code that initializes it and have a non-broken, fully-functional experience.
- **Ensure that performance is a feature**. This library should tax the developer and end user as little as possible, making the benefit of use far higher than the cost of development, maintenance or performance.

*Non-Goals*

- This library will not support configurable or drop-in replacement for another UI/Widget library.
- This library will not diverge from the http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/forms.html[HTML5 Forms spec] in order to add convenience features or non-standard behaviors.

== Features

1. Ability to initialize a +kendoForm+ custom widget from a Form in the DOM
2. Ability to interrogate types on a form and upgrade visual elements (Date, Color, etc.)
3. Ability to give all inputs a kendo look and feel (+k-input+)
4. Ability to upgrade visual form types only when not present in the current browser.
5. Ability to add Kendo UI Validation to a form
6. Ability to support forms attributes (placeholder, to be specific)
7. Ability to swap-in the Kendo UI File Upload control

== Roadmap

- v0.1 - Support upgrading all HTML5 input types (color, numeric, range, file, datatime, time, month, week)
- v0.1.1 (Current) - button support & date type support
- v0.2 - Add support for progress and datalist elements; add a placeholder fallback and search box UI; autocomplete attribute support.
- v0.3 - Add validation support 

== Compatibility and Requirements

kendo-ui-forms was designed to work with Kendo UI Web. The project currently depends on the following libraries:

- [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) v1.8.3+
- [Kendo UI](http://www.kendoui.com) vCurrent

kendo-ui-forms has not been tested against any other versions of these libraries. You may find that versions other than these are compatible with kendo-ui-forms, but we make no claims to support those version, nor can we troubleshoot issues that arise when using those versions.

== Source Code

This repository contains both the full and minified builds of the library in the +dist+ folder

== Documentation

Check out the https://github.com/kendo-labs/kendo-ui-forms/wiki/Getting-Started[Getting Started guide] in the Wiki.

A working sample of the plugin can be found in the +samples+ directory

== How to Contribute

If you would like to contribute to kendo-ui-forms's source code, please read the CONTRIBUTING.md[guidelines for pull requests and contributions]. Following these guidelines will help make your contributions easier to bring in to the next release.

== Downloading and Installing

Once you clone the repo, run

[source]
----
npm install
----

to grab all of the essential dependencies for dev, build and test. The repo uses grunt for all of these, so run

[source]
----
grunt
----

to make sure everything is working. If you see text indicating that the jshint, concat and uglify tasks have run without errors, you're golden!

== Running the Tests

Tests are written in http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/[jasmine] and can be found in the spec/ directory. To run the tests from the command-line, call

[source]
----
grunt test
----

The Kendo UI Forms Project also uses http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/index.html[Karma] to ensure cross-browser coverage of all tests. Browsers tested include:

- Google Chrome
- Google Chrome Canary
- Firefox
- Opera
- Safari [OSX Only]
- IE [Windows Only]

If you don't have any of these browsers, Karma will fail. But hey, this is cross-browser polyfill development here, so just install them all!

To run Karma, you can call

[source]
----
grunt x-test
----

and Karma will take care of launching each browser, running the specs and shutting them down again (except for Safari, for some reason, so that's awesome).

If you want to run the jasmine tests in your browser, as opposed to running the multi-browser tests or from the console every time, you can spin up a local webserver and navigate to spec/runner.html, or navigate directly via the filesystem

[source]
----
file://localhost/Users/brandon/Dropbox/Development/kendo-ui-forms/spec/runner.html
----

.Running Karma in Chrome
[NOTE]
If you're using Chrome and taking the latter approach, some of the tests will fail because of cross-domain features in Chrome. To work around this, run Chrome with the +--allow-file-access-from-files+ terminal command. 

For OSX:

[source]
----
open -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files
----

And Windows:

[source]
----
C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome[ SxS]\Application\chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files
----
